# iOS Node (internal) — Voice Trigger + Screen/Canvas

Status: design plan (internal/TestFlight) · Date: 2025-12-12

## Goals
- Build an **iOS app** that acts as a **remote node** for Clawdis:
  - **Voice trigger** (wake-word / always-listening intent) that forwards transcripts to the Gateway `agent` method.
  - **Screen/Canvas** surface that the agent can control: navigate, draw/render, evaluate JS, snapshot.
- **Dead-simple setup**:
  - Auto-discover the host on the local network via **Bonjour**.
  - One-tap pairing with an approval prompt on the Mac.
  - iOS is **never** a local gateway; it is always a remote node.
- Operational clarity:
  - When iOS is backgrounded, voice may still run; **screen/canvas commands must fail fast** with a structured error.
  - Provide **settings**: node display name, enable/disable voice wake, pairing status.

Non-goals (v1):
- Exposing the Node Gateway directly on the LAN.
- Supporting arbitrary third-party “plugins” on iOS.
- Perfect App Store compliance; this is **internal-only** initially.

## Current repo reality (constraints we respect)
- The Gateway WebSocket server binds to `127.0.0.1:18789` (`src/gateway/server.ts`) with an optional `CLAWDIS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`.
- macOS “Canvas” exists today, but is **mac-only** and controlled via mac app IPC (`clawdis-mac canvas ...`) rather than the Gateway protocol (`docs/mac/canvas.md`).
- Voice wake forwards via `GatewayChannel` to Gateway `agent` (mac app: `VoiceWakeForwarder` → `AgentRPC`).

## Recommended topology (B): macOS Bridge + loopback Gateway
Keep the Node gateway loopback-only; expose a dedicated **macOS bridge** to the LAN.

**iOS App** ⇄ (TLS + pairing) ⇄ **macOS Bridge** ⇄ (loopback) ⇄ **Gateway WS** (`ws://127.0.0.1:18789`)

Why:
- Preserves current threat model: Gateway remains local-only.
- Centralizes auth, rate limiting, and allowlisting in the bridge.
- Lets us unify “screen node” semantics across mac + iOS without exposing raw gateway methods.

## Security plan (internal, but still robust)
### Transport
- Bridge listens on LAN and uses **TLS**.
- Prefer **mutual authentication** (mTLS-like) or explicit public key pinning after pairing.

### Pairing
- Bonjour discovery shows a candidate “Clawdis Bridge” on the LAN.
- First connection:
  1) iOS generates a keypair (Secure Enclave if available).
  2) iOS connects to the bridge and requests pairing.
  3) macOS app shows “Approve node” with node name + device metadata.
  4) On approve, mac stores the node public key + permissions; iOS stores bridge identity + trust anchor in Keychain.
- Subsequent connections:
  - The bridge requires the paired identity. Unpaired clients get a structured “not paired” error and no access.

### Authorization / scope control (bridge-side ACL)
The bridge must not be a raw proxy to every gateway method.

- Allow by default:
  - `agent` (with guardrails; idempotency required)
  - minimal `system-event` beacons (presence updates for the node)
  - node/screen methods defined below (new protocol surface)
- Deny by default:
  - anything that widens control without explicit intent (future “shell”, “files”, etc.)
- Rate limit:
  - handshake attempts
  - voice forwards per minute
  - snapshot frequency / payload size

## Protocol unification: add “node/screen” to Gateway protocol
### Principle
Unify mac Canvas + iOS Canvas under a single conceptual surface:
- The agent talks to the Gateway using a stable method set (typed protocol).
- The Gateway routes node-targeted requests to:
  - local mac Canvas implementation, or
  - remote iOS node via the bridge

### Minimal protocol additions (v1)
Add to `src/gateway/protocol/schema.ts` (and regenerate Swift models):

**Identity**
- Node identity comes from `hello.client.instanceId` (stable), and `hello.client.mode = "node"` (or `"ios-node"`).

**Methods**
- `node.list` → list paired/connected nodes + capabilities
- `node.invoke` → send a command to a specific node
  - Params: `{ nodeId, command, params, idempotencyKey }`

**Events**
- `node.event` → async node status/errors
  - e.g. background/foreground transitions, voice availability, screen availability

### Node command set (screen-focused)
These are values for `node.invoke.command`:
- `screen.show` / `screen.hide`
- `screen.navigate` with `{ url }` (Canvas URL or https URL)
- `screen.eval` with `{ javaScript }`
- `screen.snapshot` with `{ maxWidth?, quality?, format? }`
- `screen.setMode` with `{ mode: "canvas" | "web" }`

Result pattern:
- Request is a standard `req/res` with `ok` / `error`.
- Long operations (loads, streaming drawing, etc.) may also emit `node.event` progress.

### Background behavior requirement
When iOS is backgrounded:
- Voice may still be active (subject to iOS suspension).
- **All `screen.*` commands must fail** with a stable error code, e.g.:
  - `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE`
  - Include `retryable: true` and `retryAfterMs` if we want the agent to wait.

## iOS app architecture (SwiftUI)
### App structure
- Tab bar:
  - **Canvas/Screen** (WKWebView + overlay chrome)
  - **Voice** (status + last transcript + test)
  - **Settings** (node name, voice wake toggle, pairing state, debug)

### Components
- `BridgeDiscovery`: Bonjour browse + resolve (Network.framework `NWBrowser`)
- `BridgeConnection`: TLS session + pairing handshake + reconnect
- `NodeRuntime`:
  - Voice pipeline (wake-word + capture + forward)
  - Screen pipeline (WKWebView controller + snapshot + eval)
  - Background state tracking; enforces “screen unavailable in background”

### Voice in background (internal)
- Enable background audio mode (and required session configuration) so the mic pipeline can keep running when the user switches apps.
- If iOS suspends the app anyway, surface a clear node status (`node.event`) so operators can see voice is unavailable.

## Code sharing (macOS + iOS)
Create/expand SwiftPM targets so both apps share:
- `ClawdisProtocol` (generated models; platform-neutral)
- `ClawdisGatewayClient` (shared WS framing + hello/req/res + seq-gap handling)
- `ClawdisNodeKit` (node.invoke command types + error codes)

macOS continues to own:
- local Canvas implementation details (custom scheme handler serving on-disk HTML, window/panel presentation)

iOS owns:
- iOS-specific audio/speech + WKWebView presentation and lifecycle

## Repo layout
- iOS app: `apps/ios/` (XcodeGen `project.yml`)
- Shared Swift packages: `apps/shared/`
- Lint/format: iOS target runs `swiftformat --lint` + `swiftlint lint` using repo configs (`.swiftformat`, `.swiftlint.yml`).

Generate the Xcode project:
```bash
cd apps/ios
xcodegen generate
open ClawdisNode.xcodeproj
```

## Storage plan (private by default)
### iOS
- Canvas/workspace files (persistent, private):
  - `Application Support/Clawdis/canvas/<sessionKey>/...`
- Snapshots / temp exports (evictable):
  - `Library/Caches/Clawdis/canvas-snapshots/<sessionKey>/...`
- Credentials:
  - Keychain (paired identity + bridge trust anchor)

### macOS
- Keep current Canvas root (already implemented):
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Clawdis/canvas/<session>/...`
- Bridge state:
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Clawdis/bridge/paired-nodes.json`
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Clawdis/bridge/keys/...`

## Rollout plan (phased)
1) **Bridge discovery + pairing (mac + iOS)**
   - Bonjour browse + resolve
   - Approve prompt on mac
   - Persist pairing in Keychain/App Support
2) **Voice-only node**
   - iOS voice wake toggle
   - Forward transcript to Gateway `agent` via bridge
   - Presence beacons via `system-event` (or node.event)
3) **Protocol additions for nodes**
   - Add `node.list` / `node.invoke` / `node.event` to Gateway
   - Implement bridge routing + ACLs
4) **iOS screen/canvas**
   - WKWebView screen surface
   - `screen.navigate/eval/snapshot`
   - Background fast-fail for `screen.*`
5) **Unify mac Canvas under the same node.invoke**
   - Keep existing implementation, but expose it through the unified protocol path so the agent uses one API.

## Open questions
- Should `hello.client.mode` be `"node"` with `platform="ios ..."` or a distinct mode `"ios-node"`? (Presence filtering currently excludes `"cli"` only.)
- Do we want a “permissions” model per node (voice only vs voice+screen) at pairing time?
- Should “website mode” allow arbitrary https, or enforce an allowlist to reduce risk?
