# `clawdbot configure`

Interactive prompt to set up credentials, devices, and agent defaults.

Tip: `clawdbot config` without a subcommand opens the same wizard. Use
`clawdbot config get|set|unset` for non-interactive edits.

Notes:
- Choosing where the Gateway runs always updates `gateway.mode`. You can select "Continue" without other sections if that is all you need.

## Examples

```bash
clawdbot configure
clawdbot configure --section models --section channels
```
