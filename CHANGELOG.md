# Changelog

## 1.5.0 — 2025-12-05

### Breaking
- Dropped all non-Pi agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Opencode); `inbound.reply.agent.kind` now only accepts `"pi"` and related CLI helpers have been removed.
- Removed Twilio support and all related commands/options (webhook/up/provider flags/wait-poll); CLAWDIS is Baileys Web-only.

### Changes
- Default agent handling now favors Pi RPC while falling back to the plain command runner for non-Pi invocations, keeping heartbeat/session plumbing intact.
- Documentation updated to reflect Pi-only support and to mark legacy Claude paths as historical.
- Status command reports web session health + session recipients; config paths are locked to `~/.clawdis` with session metadata stored under `~/.clawdis/sessions/`.
- Simplified send/agent/relay/heartbeat to web-only delivery; removed Twilio mocks/tests and dead code.
- Tau RPC timeout is now inactivity-based (5m without events) and error messages show seconds only.
- Pi/Tau sessions now write to `~/.clawdis/sessions/` by default (legacy `~/.tau/agent/sessions/clawdis` files are copied over when present).
- Directive triggers (`/think`, `/verbose`, `/stop` et al.) now reply immediately using normalized bodies (timestamps/group prefixes stripped) without waiting for the agent.
- Directive/system acks carry a `⚙️` prefix and verbose parsing rejects typoed `/ver*` strings so unrelated text doesn’t flip verbosity.
- Batched history blocks no longer trip directive parsing; `/think` in prior messages won't emit stray acknowledgements.
- RPC fallbacks no longer echo the user's prompt (e.g., pasting a link) when the agent returns no assistant text.
- Heartbeat prompts with `/think` no longer send directive acks; heartbeat replies stay silent on settings.
- `clawdis sessions` now renders a colored table (a la oracle) with context usage shown in k tokens and percent of the context window.

## 1.4.1 — 2025-12-04

### Changes
- Added `warelay agent` CLI command to talk directly to the configured agent using existing session handling (no WhatsApp send), with JSON output and delivery option.
- `/new` reset trigger now works even when inbound messages have timestamp prefixes (e.g., `[Dec 4 17:35]`).
- WhatsApp mention parsing accepts nullable arrays and flattens safely to avoid missed mentions.

## 1.4.0 — 2025-12-03

### Highlights
- **Thinking directives & state:** `/t|/think|/thinking <level>` (aliases off|minimal|low|medium|high|max/highest). Inline applies to that message; directive-only message pins the level for the session; `/think:off` clears. Resolution: inline > session override > `inbound.reply.thinkingDefault` > off. Pi/Tau get `--thinking <level>` (except off); other agents append cue words (`think` → `think hard` → `think harder` → `ultrathink`). Heartbeat probe uses `HEARTBEAT /think:high`.
- **Group chats (web provider):** Warelay now fully supports WhatsApp groups: mention-gated triggers (including image-only @ mentions), recent group history injection, per-group sessions, sender attribution, and a first-turn primer with group subject/member roster; heartbeats are skipped for groups.
- **Group session primer:** The first turn of a group session now tells the agent it is in a WhatsApp group and lists known members/subject so it can address the right speaker.
- **Media failures are surfaced:** When a web auto-reply media fetch/send fails (e.g., HTTP 404), we now append a warning to the fallback text so you know the attachment was skipped.
- **Verbose directives + session hints:** `/v|/verbose on|full|off` mirrors thinking: inline > session > config default. Directive-only replies with an acknowledgement; invalid levels return a hint. When enabled, tool results from JSON-emitting agents (Pi/Tau, etc.) are forwarded as metadata-only `[🛠️ <tool-name> <arg>]` messages (now streamed as they happen), and new sessions surface a `🧭 New session: <id>` hint.
- **Verbose tool coalescing:** successive tool results of the same tool within ~1s are batched into one `[🛠️ tool] arg1, arg2` message to reduce WhatsApp noise.
- **Directive confirmations:** Directive-only messages now reply with an acknowledgement (`Thinking level set to high.` / `Thinking disabled.`) and reject unknown levels with a helpful hint (state is unchanged).
- **Pi/Tau stability:** RPC replies buffered until the assistant turn finishes; parsers return consistent `texts[]`; web auto-replies keep a warm Tau RPC process to avoid cold starts.
- **Claude prompt flow:** One-time `sessionIntro` with per-message `/think:high` bodyPrefix; system prompt always sent on first turn even with `sendSystemOnce`.
- **Heartbeat UX:** Backpressure skips reply heartbeats while other commands run; skips don’t refresh session `updatedAt`; web heartbeats normalize array payloads and optional `heartbeatCommand`.
- **Control via WhatsApp:** Send `/restart` to restart the launchd service (`com.steipete.clawdis`; legacy `com.steipete.warelay`) from your allowed numbers.
- **Tau completion signal:** RPC now resolves on Tau’s `agent_end` (or process exit) so late assistant messages aren’t truncated; 5-minute hard cap only as a failsafe.

### Reliability & UX
- Outbound chunking prefers newlines/word boundaries and enforces caps (~4000 chars for web/WhatsApp).
- Web auto-replies fall back to caption-only if media send fails; hosted media MIME-sniffed and cleaned up immediately.
- IPC relay send shows typing indicator; batched inbound messages keep timestamps; watchdog restarts WhatsApp after long inactivity.
- Early `allowFrom` filtering prevents decryption errors; same-phone mode supported with echo suppression.
- All console output is now mirrored into pino logs (still printed to stdout/stderr), so verbose runs keep full traces.
- `--verbose` now forces log level `trace` (was `debug`) to capture every event.
- Verbose tool messages now include emoji + args + a short result preview for bash/read/edit/write/attach (derived from RPC tool start/end events).

### Security / Hardening
- IPC socket hardened (0700 dir / 0600 socket, no symlinks/foreign owners); `warelay logout` also prunes session store.
- Media server blocks symlinks and enforces path containment; logging rotates daily and prunes >24h.

### Bug Fixes
- Web group chats now bypass the second `allowFrom` check (we still enforce it on the group participant at inbox ingest), so mentioned group messages reply even when the group JID isn’t in your allowlist.
- `logVerbose` also writes to the configured Pino logger at debug level (without breaking stdout).
- Group auto-replies now append the triggering sender (`[from: Name (+E164)]`) to the batch body so agents can address the right person in group chats.
- Media-only pings now pick up mentions inside captions (image/video/etc.), so @-mentions on media-only messages trigger replies.
- MIME sniffing and redirect handling for downloads/hosted media.
- Response prefix applied to heartbeat alerts; heartbeat array payloads handled for both providers.
- Tau RPC typing exposes `signal`/`killed`; NDJSON parsers normalized across agents.
- Tau (pi) session resumes now append `--continue`, so existing history/think level are reloaded instead of starting empty.

### Testing
- Fixtures isolate session stores; added coverage for thinking directives, stateful levels, heartbeat backpressure, and agent parsing.

## 1.3.0 — 2025-12-02

### Highlights
- **Pluggable agents (Claude, Pi, Codex, Opencode):** `inbound.reply.agent` selects CLI/parser; per-agent argv builders and NDJSON parsers enable swapping without template changes.
- **Safety stop words:** `stop|esc|abort|wait|exit` immediately reply “Agent was aborted.” and mark the session so the next prompt is prefixed with an abort reminder.
- **Agent session reliability:** Only Claude returns a stable `session_id`; others may reset between runs.

### Bug Fixes
- Empty `result` fields no longer leak raw JSON to users.
- Heartbeat alerts now honor `responsePrefix`.
- Command failures return user-friendly messages.
- Test session isolation to avoid touching real `sessions.json`.
- IPC reuse for `warelay send/heartbeat` prevents Signal/WhatsApp session corruption.
- Web send respects media kind (image/audio/video/document) with correct limits.

### Changes
- IPC relay socket at `~/.warelay/relay.sock` with automatic CLI fallback.
- Batched inbound messages with timestamps; typing indicator after IPC sends.
- Watchdog restarts WhatsApp after long inactivity; heartbeat logging includes minutes since last message.
- Early `allowFrom` filtering before decryption.
- Same-phone mode with echo detection and optional `inbound.samePhoneMarker`.

## 1.2.2 — 2025-11-28
